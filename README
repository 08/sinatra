Using Sinatra is EASY!

WARNING:  Keep a fresh pair of underwear nearby.  You may need them when you see this.

Get running without a file!

ruby -e 'require "sinatra"'  # HIT http://localhost:4567/ and BAM!

now create a file called test.rb (or whatever you fancy) and enter this:

require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  body 'Hello World!'
end

now run 'ruby test.rb' and refresh your browser

Oh yeah!
